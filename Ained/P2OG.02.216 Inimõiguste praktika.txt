The practice must involve the accomplishment of law-related tasks (focusing either on international law or human rights aspects), under the supervision of a person preferably with master's degree in law (as immediate supervisor). The student must follow the internal rules applicable at the place of practice.

After completing his/her practice, two reports have to be submitted to the Programme management:
- one assessment by the supervisor, describing the student's tasks and his/her performance, mentioning whether the student had the necessary theoretical background and whether he/she was able to apply them in practice, whether the student was able to integrate in a team and work with the others etc. This report has to be signed digitally and send to the programme's secretariat or signed and sent in sealed envelope to the School of Law in Tallinn).
- one self-assessment by the student, explaining where the practice was done, what legal tasks were performed during the practice, what were the benefits of the practice, reflecting on his/her learning achievements (to submit by e-mail to the secretariat of the programme).

There is no specific template for the reports, but please turn to the Programme Director for advice.

The Programme Director will evaluate the reports and decide upon awarding the corresponding 6 ECTS, either as practice in international law (P2OG.02.215) or practice in human rights (P2OG.02.216). If necessary, a meeting to discuss the practice results is organised.
Each student in the Master Programme in International Law and Human Rights must complete a practice (internship) in the field of international law or human rights depending on his/her preferences and the availability of practice positions.
The goal of the module is to give the student a possibility to deepen and apply the knowledge of international law or human rights, acquired during the studies, and to gain practical professional skills and experience.
Place of Practice: the practice must be performed within an institution (e.g. ministry, inter- or non-governmental organisation, company) that deals with the legal issues related to international law or human rights. In order to avoid later problems, the student ought to consult on beforehand with the Programme Director  the suitability of the institution as a place of practice. 
Duration: The practice must last at least four full-time weeks (6 ECTS). One ECTS corresponds to 26 hours of studies performed by a student. 4 weeks imply an effort of 156 hours. The student may perform his/her practice during the study time, provided that it does not conflict with other study obligations.
NB. For students who pass the course "Human Rights and Education" (P2OG.02.219), a special module of practice is organised, which involves teaching human rights. This will be credited under P2OG.02.216. For more details contact elizabeth.kasa-malksoo@ut.ee
