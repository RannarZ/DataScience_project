Practice Report
After completing his/her practice, the student prepares a practice report explaining where the practice was done, what legal tasks performed during the practice, what where the benefits the practice, etc. The report should include a more detailed coverage of one specific case or issue on which the student worked. The practice report must be signed by the immediate supervisor. The immediate supervisor provides a separate assessment of the student, e.g. did the student have necessary theoretical background, was the student able to apply theoretical knowledge to practical situations, how the student was able to integrate into the team and work with others. The assessment must not be shown to the student, but given in a sealed envelope which the student attaches to his/her practice report. The student submits his/her practice report to the contact person (currently Lehte Leesik) at the School at the earliest convenience. There is no specific form for a practice report or an assessment. 
Assessment of the Practice Report
School's practice supervisors review the practice report, and decide whether the practice was related more to international law or human rights and whether the student receives the credits in the form of P2OG.02.215 International Law Practice (6 ECTS) or P2OG.02.216 Human Rights Law Practice (6 ECTS). If necessary, they will meet with the student to discuss the practice and its results. The final result of the practice is either passed or not passed.
General
Each student must complete a practice (internship) in the field of international law or human rights depending on his/her preferences and the availability of practice positions. The practice must last at least four full-time weeks (6 ECTS). 
(4 weeks, one ECTS corresponds to 26 hours of studies performed by student). The student may perform his/her practice at the time provided that it does not conflict with other study obligations.
Place of Practice
The practice must be performed:
With an institution (e.g. ministry, inter- or non-governmental organisation, company) that deals with the legal issues related to international law of human rights, and Under the supervision of a person with master's degree in law (immediate supervisor). In order to avoid later problems, the student ought to consult with the Programme Director regarding the suitability of the institution as a place of practice. The student must follow the internal rules applicable at the place of practice
