The course will start with a conceptual definition of far-right and populist movements and then it will look at specific case studies in the European context. This course will provide a systematic overview of the populist radical right analyzing the actors, supporters and different venues where the PRR is active as well as the impact that this party family has had and is likely to have on Europe. This course will also introduce methods for social science writing, culminating in a research paper which students will produce at the end of the course. Class discussion about the course content will encourage students to think critically and sharpen their analytical skills.
This course aims to give a systematic overview of the populist radical right (PRR) party family in Europe. The populist radical right (PRR) is a party family that is rising in popularity throughout most of Europe. In recent years, the PRR has gained unprecedented momentum and success. At first, the populist radical right was a marginal political force on the extreme end of the spectrum in most European countries. Then, these parties began to use the European elections as a litmus test to increase their visibility and test their political platforms. Finally, the populist radical right began to win key elections and in 2014, Europe was hit by the "Eurosceptic earthquake" that saw PRR parties win an unprecedented number of seats in the European parliament. The last two years have also seen a rise in support for the populist radical right primarily due to the refugee crisis.
The course will start with a conceptual definition of far-right and populist movements and then it will look at specific case studies in the European context.
At the end of the course, students will have a solid understanding of several aspects of the populist radical right in Europe, including how these parties operate on the natioanal and the European level; party ideologies; relationship withe the Russian Federation and differeing attitudes towards the European project.
