1. Setting up ROS, Gazebo simulation for visual servoing
2. Setting up Open-Cv for object identification using camera
3. Motion planning and feedback control programming
4. Setting up of visual servoing demo in simulation and real-hardware.
1. To help students prepare for the Delta-X drone competition. 
2. To provide hands-on experience with computer vision and control technologies related to developing real-world applications with quadrotor drones and mobile robots.
At the end of the course, the students will have
1. Conceptual, technical and hands-on experience with visual servoing, object identification and tracking using computer vision techniques.
2. Conceptual and hands-on experience with motion planning and feedback control of quadrotor drones and their implementation on hardware using Robot Operating System API.
3. The students will also be able to formulate how deep-learning concepts can be applied to the Delta-X drone competition problem statement.
