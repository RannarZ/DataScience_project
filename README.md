# LLM based course finder

This is a project by Anton Berik and Rannar Zirk.

The project works on GPT 3.5 model and is aimed for bachelor's students. 

Currently it is usable only via the .ipynb file where it is mandatory to run the blocks that have a mark for running and at the end there is a prototype block where you can type an input. After typing an input the GPT model does it's magic and the user will get 10 courses that fit the best to his/her request.
